## What is a Centralized Application?

**So, ** what is this actually? 

First, let's talk about what is an *application*. 

An *application *is a computer program with an interface, enabling people to use the computer as a tool to accomplish a specific task. That means, a tool that fulfills our needs through the internet. That's it. 

For eg, if you want to buy a mobile from an online store, then you must need a platform to purchase it. This may be from your mobile or computer. Right? That platform is called an *Application*. Suppose, if you want to buy an iPhone 13 online, let's say from *amazon*, here, *amazon *is the *platform *that you are using for making the purchase. So, *amazon *is the *application*. 

Got an idea of what an application is? 

Awesome!

Now, let's understand what's a **Centralized Application**. 

*Centralized application*, is an *application*, where both data and functionality(business logic) reside on a server that is owned and controlled by a single entity. This entity can be an organization or an individual. 

Getting confused? 

Cool!

In simple words, It's an *application * which is managed by a company or an organization or like this, who can fully control this *application* and its functionalities. 

You purchased an iPhone from *Amazon*, right? Let's take this to explore more. 

When you are going to open an account on *amazon*, you are giving personal details to it, like *name, email, mob etc*. Your details are stored inside *amazon's *database. Here, *amazon *can view your data, can view your order history, also *amazon *can modify it(likely they are not). *Amazon *has full access to your data. So, here *amazon *acts as a *Centralized Application*. 

Like this, let's take another application. For eg, when you are making a train ticket booking from the IRCTC application, you are giving IRCTC to your personal data(*name, mob, journey details, etc*). IRCTC has full access to your data. So, here IRCTC acts as a *centralized application*. 

Here is the structure of the *centralized application*.

In this picture, you can say the **server **is amazon and the **client **is you, who made the purchase. Let's end this...

- In *centralized application* data is owned and controlled by the server. 

- Functionality is owned and controlled by the server. 

- It makes use of the Hub and Spoke(star) network model(used in the picture).

Now, we reached the end of what a *centralized application* is. I'm pretty sure, you are now clearly understood about the *centralized application*.
